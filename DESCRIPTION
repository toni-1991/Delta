Description: Measure of agreement Delta was originally by MartÃ­n & Femia on 
    2004. Since then has been considered as agreement measure for different 
	fields, since their behavior is usually better than the usual Kappa index
	(Cohen, 1960). The main issue with Delta is that can not be computed by 
	hand contrary to Kappa.
