Description: Measure of agreement Delta was originally by Mart√≠n & Femia (2004) <DOI:10.1348/000711004849268>. 
    Since then has been considered as agreement measure for different 
	fields, since their behavior is usually better than the usual Kappa index
	by Cohen (1960) <DOI:10.1177/001316446002000104>. The main issue with Delta 
	is that can not be computed by hand contrary to Kappa. The current algorithm
    is based on the Version 5 of the Delta windows program that can be found on
